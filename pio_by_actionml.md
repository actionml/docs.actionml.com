# PredictionIO and ActionML

ActionML has moved development to the next-gen [Harness ML/AI Server](/docs/harness_intro). If you are currently using PredictionIO you may be interested in our [Upgrade Guide](/docs/upgrading_from_pio_to_harness).

In the past we have supported Apache PredictionIO 0.10.0 to 0.12.1. We continue to make our extra howtos, documents, and templates available but check the [Apache site](http://predictionio.incubator.apache.org/) for more information.

For help installing Apache PredictionIO-{{> pioversionnum}} please follow [these instructions](/docs/install) to install.

For a description of past versions see the [history](/docs/pio_versions)
