# PredictionIO and ActionML

ActionML supports and directly commits code to Apache PredictionIO beginning with Apache PredictionIO-{{> pioversionnum}}. All added features that we created in our fork have been contributed and merged into Apache PredictionIO so we are now in sync. We may have some extra howtos, documents and certainly templates but check the [Apache site](http://predictionio.incubator.apache.org/) for more information.

For help installing Apache PredictionIO-{{> pioversionnum}} please follow [these instructions](/docs/install) to install or upgrade from the ActionML version.

For a description of past versions see the [history](/docs/pio_versions)
