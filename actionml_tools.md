# ActionML Tools

ActionML maintains tools useful in running PredictionIO like Docker containers, Chef recipes, Terraform scripts, and ancillary PIO Templates. Some of these are OSS but not supported beyond making the code available and some are private because they are not usable without training. The private tools are used in our custom deployments so contact ActionML support for questions about them (that button floating to the right).

For general descriptions of Docker containers, Chef recipes, and other tools see our [GitHub page](https://github.com/actionml).

For the Db-cleaner template see the [docs page](/docs/db_cleaner_template)
