# Harness and Engine Installation

Harness and the Universal Recommender (as well as all included Engines) can be installed natively on your 'nix compatible OS but is more simply deployed from pre-built Docker containers.

 - **[Harness Container Quickstart](harness_container_guide)**: explains deploying Harness and the Harness-CLI via containers.
 - **[Harness Native Installation Guide](harness_native_guide)**: this not-so-quick start explains installing from a source build and running natively on your OS.
 - **[Harness Cluster](/#contact)**: for deploymewnts that need container orchestration such as Kubernetes or Docker-compose hit [contact us](/#contact).
 - **[Harness on AWS](/#contact)**: ***Coming soon***, a full function Harness + UR Server in an AWS AMI ready for instant installation.
 - **[Secure Harness](/#contact)**: for a version of Harness that can be accessed through the internet using TLS/SSL and Authentication/Authorization. This is not typically needed since Harness usually runs in your datacenter or virtual private cloud and is accessed securely only through your Application Servers, not directly from clients via the internet.
