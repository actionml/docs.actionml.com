# The Universal Recommender Version Log

## Roadmap

PIO-0.11.0 supports use of Elasticsearch 5.x, Spark 2.x, and Scala 2.11. The UR can be compiled for all these except ES 5.x by changing the `build.sbt` file. In a minor release we will provide alternative `build.sbt` files as examples of how to do this. ES 5 support is nearly ready in a PR and will be incorporated as soon as it is ready. ES 5 uses the REST API exclusively and so will support authentication and certain ES as a service hosts. It also has some significant performance improvements.

## v0.6.0

This is a major upgrade release with several new features. Backward compatibility with 0.5.0 is maintained. **Note**: We no longer have a default `engine.json` file so you will need to copy `engine.json.template` to `engine.json` and edit it to fit your data. See the [Universal Recommender Configuration](http://actionml.com/docs/ur_config) docs.

 - **Performance**: Nearly a 40% speedup for most model calculation, and a new tuning parameter that can yield further speed improvements by filtering out unused or less useful data from model building. See `minEventsPerUser` in the UR configuration docs.
 - **Complimentary Purchase aka Item-set Recommendations**: "Shopping-cart" type recommendations. Can be used for wishlists, favorites, watchlists, any list based recommendations. Used with list or user data.
 - **Exclusion Rules**: now we have business rules for inclusion, exclusion, and boosts based on item properties.
 - **PredictionIO 0.11.0**: Full compatibility, but no support for Elasticsearch 5, an option with PIO-0.11.0.
 - **New Advanced Tuning**: Allows several new per indicator / event type tuning parameters for tuning model quality in a more targeted way.
 - **Norms Support**: For large dense datasets norms are now the default for model indexing and queries. This should result in slight precision gains, so better results. 
 - **Mahout 0.13.0 Support**: the UR no longer requires a local build of Mahout.  
 - **GPU Support**: via Mahout 0.13.0 the core math of the UR now supports the use of GPUs for acceleration.
 - **Timeout Protection**: Queries for users with very large histories could cause a timeout. We now correctly limit the amount of user history that is used as per documentation, which will all but eliminate timeouts. 
 - **Bug Fixes**: The use of `blackListEvents` as defined in `engine.json` was not working for an empty list, which should and now does disable any blacklisting except explicit item blacklists contained in the query.

## v0.5.0

 - **Apache PIO Compatible**: The first UR version compatible with Apache PredictionIO-0.10.0-incubating. All past versions do not work and should be upgraded to this. The ActionML build of PIO is permanently deprecated since it is merged with Apache PIO.

## v0.4.2 **Replaces 0.4.1**

 - **Fixes bug** when a `pio build` failure triggered by the release of Apache PIO. If you have problems building v0.4.0 use this version. It is meant to be used with PredictionIO-0.9.7-aml.
 - **Requires a custom build of Apache Mahout**: instructions on the [doc site](http://actionml.com/docs/ur_quickstart) This is temporary until the next Mahout release, when we will update to 0.4.3 (uses predicitonio-0.9.7-aml) and 0.5.0 (which uses predictionio-0.10.0 from Apache)

## v0.4.0

 - This version requires PredictionIO-0.9.7-aml found [here](http://actionml/docs/install).
 - **New tuning params** are now available for each "indicator" type, making indicators with a small number of possible values much more useful&mdash;things like gender or category-preference. See docs for [configuring the UR](http://actionml.com/docs/ur_config) and look for the `indicators` parameter.
 - **New forms of recommendations backfill** allow all items to be recommended even if they have no user events yet. Backfill types include random and user defined. See docs for [configuring the UR](http://actionml.com/docs/ur_config) and look for the `rankings` parameter.

## v0.3.0

 - This version requires PredictionIO-0.9.7-aml from the ActionML repo [here](http://actionml/docs/install).
 - **Implements a moving time window if events**: Now supports the `SelfCleanedDataSource` trait. Adding params to the `DataSource` part of `engine.json` allows control of de-duplication, property event compaction, and a time window of event. The time window is used to age out the oldest events. Note: this only works with the ActionML fork of PredictionIO found in the repo mentioned above.
 - **Parameter changed**: `backfillField: duration` to accept Scala Duration strings. This will require changes to all engine.json files that were using the older # of seconds duration.
 - **Event-types used in queries**: added support for indicator predictiveness testing with the MAP@k tool. This is so only certain mixes of user events are used at query time.
 - **Bug fix**: which requires that the `typeName` in engine.json is required be `"items"`, with this release the type can be any string.

## v0.2.3

 - removed isEmpty calls that were taking an extremely long time to execute, results in considerable speedup. Now the vast majority of `pio train` time is taken up by writing to Elasticsearch. This can be optimized by creating and ES cluster or giving ES lots of memory.
 
## v0.2.2

 - a query with no item or user will get recommendations based on popularity
 - a new integration test has been added
 - a regression bug where some ids were being tokenized by Elasticsearch, leading to incorrect results, was fixed. **NOTE: for users with complex ids containing dashes or spaces this is an important fix.**
 - a dateRange in the query now takes precedence to the item attached expiration and available dates. 

## v0.2.1

 - date ranges attached to items will be compared to the prediction servers current data if no date is provided in the query. 

## v0.2.0

 - date range filters implemented
 - hot/trending/popular used for backfill and when no other recommendations are returned by the query
 - filters/bias < 0 caused scores to be altered in v0.1.1 fixed in this version so filters have no effect on scoring.
 - the model is now hot-swapped in Elasticsearch so no downtime should be seen, in fact there is no need to run `pio deploy` to make the new model active.
 - it is now possible to have an engine.json (call it something else) dedicated to recalculating the popularity model. This allows fast updates to popularity without recalculating the collaborative filtering model.
 - Elasticsearch can now be in cluster mode

## v0.1.1

 - ids are now exact matches, for v0.1.0 the ids had to be lower case and were subject to tokenizing analysis so using that version is not recommended.

## v0.1.0

 - user and item based queries supported
 - multiple usage events supported
 - filters and boosts supported on item properties and on user or item based results.
 - fast writing to Elasticsearch using Spark
 - convention over configuration for queries, defaults make simple/typical queries simple and overrides add greater expressiveness.
