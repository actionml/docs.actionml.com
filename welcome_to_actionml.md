# Emphasis
```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

# Lists

```Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

# Links

```
Links

There are two ways to create links.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

# Inline `code` with backticks

# Code blocks with tiple backticks and different hughlighting style per language

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

# Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Youtube videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```


Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)

# Welcome to ActionML

We help people build Machine learning into their Apps. We create, the systems, algorithms, and infrastructure to make machine intelligence practical. We help customize or invent what is needed then we maintain open source implementations of it all. Try it and if you need help [contact us](/#contact) us or ask for [community support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/actionml-user) 

## Algorithms

 - **The Universal Recommender**: Perhaps the most flexible recommender in open source. Implemented as a complete end-to-end integrated system that you can run on premises or we can run it for you. The Universal Recommender contains a new Correlation Engine approach to ingesting data from many sources to make recommendations better. See the description [here](/docs/universal-recommender)
 
 - **The Page Variant Recommender**: Based on a Contextual Multi-armed Bandit, this algorithm allows you to instrument a site or mobile app to evolve into something pleasing to specific users. Pick a set of pages and the PVR finds which versions cause the best response to which users types. [Contact us](/#contact) if you are interested while we are preparing it's release.
 
 - **Behavioral Search**: This algorithm takes in data we know about users, learns what leads to purchases or reads, then hands this data back to you for inclusion in your content index. The augmenting data makes search personalized, which leads to greater user satisfaction as measured by sales (Amazon has claimed 3% sales lift for a similar algorithm).
 
## Machine Learning Libraries

 - **Spark MLlib**: Many of our Big Data algorithms are taken from Spark's MLlib then built into our production ready system. This Library supplies the algorithms for classification, single action recommenders, and clustering.

 - **Vowpal Wabbit**: Our Small Data (only requires a single machine) or streaming online learning algorithms come from Vowpal Wabbit, a well respected Machine learning library. It is at the core of our Page Variant Recommender.

 - **Apache Mahout**: Mahout Samsara is a reinvention of Mahout as a Big Data "roll your own math and algorithms" engine. Something like R but implemented in Scala as an R-like DSL, which runs on the latest fast execution engines like Spark and Flink. We use and commit to the project, which is at the core of the Universal Recommender.
 
 - **Others**: We are constantly cherry-picking open source for the best new technologies to solve real problems. Describe what you want your app to do and we can help find the right technology.
 
## PredictionIO

We maintain a fork of PredictionIO with some extra features. We use it to customize solutions and deliver scalable reliable systems. We deliver our algorithms as PredictionIO Templates.
